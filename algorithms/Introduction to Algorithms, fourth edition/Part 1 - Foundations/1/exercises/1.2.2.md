Q: Suppose that for inputs of size n on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps and merge sort runs in 64nlg(n) steps For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

- Insert sort beats merge sort when the time to sort all items in the input is smaller than merge sort.Â So:

$8n^2 < 64nln(n)$
$n < 8ln(n)$
