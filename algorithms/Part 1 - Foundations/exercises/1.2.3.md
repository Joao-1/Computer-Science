Q: What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine?
  
- $100n^2 < 2^n$
- $n^2<\frac{2^n}{100}$
- $n<\sqrt{ \frac{2^n}{100} }$

To find the smallest value of n, we can use a calculator to find the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality or resolve the inequality, but this is not the purpose of this exercise. So I only give the answer calculed by Wolfram Alpha: $n=15$.
